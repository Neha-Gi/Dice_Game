Dice Game Project
This Python-based Dice Game project implements a simple turn-based game where players roll an 8-faced dice aiming to reach 50 points to win.
The game supports multiple players with customizable names and features.
special rules: rolling a 4 resets the player's score to 0, and rolling an 8 doubles the points earned. 
The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including abstraction and composition, through the use of classes and inheritance. 
To play, simply run the Play_dice_game.py file, enter the number and names of players, and take turns 
rolling the dice. The first player to reach 50 points wins the game. 
No additional libraries are required, and contributions are welcome through pull requests.
